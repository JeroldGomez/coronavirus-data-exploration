# Coronavirus Data Exploration


## Objective
This project aims to conduct SQL data exploration and visualization of COVID-19 data to gain insights into the impact of the pandemic. The main objectives include:

1. **Proportion of Population Infected by COVID-19 in Each Country:** Analyze the data to calculate the proportion of each country's population that has been infected by COVID-19, allowing us to understand the spread of the virus on a global scale.

2. **Mortality Rates Across Regions:** Explore the dataset to calculate and visualize mortality rates for different regions, enabling us to identify areas with higher mortality rates and potential disparities.

3. **Total Confirmed COVID-19 Deaths by Geographic Regions:** Use SQL queries to aggregate and visualize the total confirmed COVID-19 deaths in various geographic regions, providing a clear overview of the impact of the virus on a regional level.

4. **Daily Death Count:** Calculate and visualize the daily count of COVID-19 deaths, allowing us to observe trends, spikes, and fluctuations in mortality on a daily basis.



## Data Source
The data for this project was obtained from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths#what-is-the-daily-number-of-confirmed-deaths, specifically focusing on COVID-19-related statistics such as total cases, deaths, population, and other relevant metrics. The dataset provides valuable information for understanding the impact of the pandemic across different countries and regions.

## Data Exploration
To conduct the data exploration and visualization, SQL queries were employed to aggregate and transform the data. Using SQL allows me to perform calculations, filtering, and grouping to derive meaningful insights from the dataset.

## Visualizations
Several visualizations were created to better understand the data:

1. Proportion of Population Infected: A map chart illustrating the proportion of the population that has been infected by COVID-19 in each country, showcasing the varying impact across different nations.

2. Mortality Rates Across Regions: A bar chart displaying the distribution of mortality rates across different regions, highlighting areas with higher or lower rates.

3. Total Confirmed Deaths by Regions: An area chart showcasing the total confirmed COVID-19 deaths in various geographic regions, providing a geographic perspective on the pandemic's impact.

4. Daily Death Count Trends: An area chart depicting the daily count of COVID-19 deaths over time, helping us identify trends, spikes, and patterns in mortality rates.

At first glance, the visualization for the daily death count appears problematic. It displays a pattern of sharp, repeating spikes rather than a smooth curve, which can make it difficult to interpret the true progression of the pandemic's waves. The color gradient, which represents the total number of deaths, is also obscured by this extreme daily volatility.

`Is the Visualization Wrong? No, It's Accurately Reflecting Reality.`

Contrary to what one might assume, this "spiky" visualization is not the result of an error in the SQL query or the visualization tool. Instead, it is an accurate representation of how real-world public health data is reported.

The primary reason for these regular spikes is inconsistent reporting schedules, especially on weekends.
- Weekend Lag: Most health departments and government agencies do not report data, or report incomplete data, on Saturdays and Sundays.
- Weekday Catch-up: This backlog of data from the weekend is then processed and reported in a large batch on Mondays or Tuesdays, resulting in a dramatic spike in the numbers for those days.

Therefore, while the visualization may look "wrong" from a trend-analysis perspective, it correctly shows the raw, day-to-day data as it was made available to the public.

## Tech Stack
This project was carried out using a combination of several tools and software to analyze and visualize the COVID-19 data effectively:

* Microsoft Excel: Microsoft Excel was employed to preprocess and organize the data before importing it into the SQL environment.

* SQL: SQL queries were crafted and executed in SQL Server Management Studio to explore the dataset, aggregate information, and derive insights.

* Tableau: Tableau was utilized to create various visualizations that showcase the trends, patterns, and distributions within the COVID-19 dataset.
